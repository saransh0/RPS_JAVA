//  Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-person game typically played using hand gestures.
//  Both players make a fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward. Together,
//  they tap their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on the third time form one
//  of three items: a rock (by keeping the hand in a fist), a sheet of paper (by holding
//  the hand flat, palm down), or a pair of scissors (by extending the first two fingers
//  and holding them apart in a “V”).
//
// There are only three possible outcomes other than a tie:
//  1) Rock cuts Scissors
//  2) Paper covers Rock
//  3) Scissors cuts Paper
//
// If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie.
